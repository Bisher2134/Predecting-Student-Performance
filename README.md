# Predecting-Student-Performance

This project explores different machine learning classification algorithms to predict student performance using a range of features. The goal is to identify patterns and build interpretable models that help educators and administrators identify at-risk students.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Overview

This repository contains three core Jupyter notebooks that walk through the entire process:

| Notebook      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `lesson1.ipynb` | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), initial preprocessing, and overview of the dataset |
| `lesson2.ipynb` | Implementation of ID3 algorithm from scratch and performance evaluation |
| `lesson3.ipynb` | C4.5 algorithm implementation and comparison with ID3 |

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3):** Builds decision trees using information gain.
- **C4.5:** Extension of ID3 that uses gain ratio, handles continuous values, and manages missing data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dataset

The dataset should include features such as:

- Gender
- Board Exam Scores (Class X and XII)
- Entrance Exam Rank
- Attendance
- LMS Engagement
- Final Grade or Classification

> Ensure that `dataset.csv` is placed in the project root or adjust paths in the notebooks.
