Project description : 

In this project, we successfully developed a predictive model to determine whether a student is likely to pass or fail their final exam based on key academic indicators. By using a logistic regression model and selecting features such as study time, past failures, and grades from earlier periods (G1 and G2), we were able to make accurate binary predictions (pass/fail) from the student performance dataset.

This model demonstrates how data science can support early intervention by identifying students who may need additional academic support. While the initial results are promising, the project also reveals opportunities for improvement â€” such as incorporating more features, experimenting with advanced models, and improving interpretability.

Ultimately, this project highlights the practical value of machine learning in the education sector and encourages further exploration into data-driven strategies for enhancing student success.


Learning outcomes : 

Design and deliver a student-friendly, interactive mini-course DataCamp-style that 
teaches complete beginners how to apply the data science workflow to a relatable 
problem: Can we predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam ?

Setup instructions : 
  Run from lesson 1 to lesson 4 sequentially

Student challenge :
 from lesson 3 we see some features useless if we drop it what should happen ???
